## Jesus, I Will Follow Thee

Jesus, I will follow thee,
For I hear thee calling me;
Loving, trusting, glad I come,
To let thee lead me home.

Chorus
I will follow thee,
I will follow thee, 
I will follow thee
Wherever thou dost lead.

Little eyes might lose the way,
Little feet might go astray;
I might weak and weary be,
But thou art strong for me.

Grief and want may be my foes,
Foolish sins my way oppose;
Full of courage I will be,
Whene'er I follow thee.
