## Jesus, The Light Of The World

Hark! the herald angels sing, 
Jesus, the light of the world.
Glory to the newborn King, 
Jesus, the light of the world.

Chorus
Weâ€™ll walk in the light, beautiful light. 
Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright.
O, shine all around us by day and by night. 
Jesus the light of the world.

Joyful, all you nations, rise. 
Jesus, the light of the world. 
Join the triumph of the skies.
Jesus, the light of the world. 

Christ, by highest heaven adored; 
Jesus, the light of the world.
Christ, the everlasting Lord;
Jesus, the light of the world. 

Hail, the heaven born Prince of Peace! 
Jesus, the light of the world.
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness!
Jesus, the light of the world.
