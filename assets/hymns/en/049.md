## One Sweetly Solemn Thought

One sweetly solemn thought
Comes to me o'er and o'er;
Nearer my home today am I
Than e'er I've been before.

Nearer my Father's house,
Where many mansions be,
Nearer today, the great white throne,
Nearer the crystal sea.

Nearer the bound of life,
Where burdens are laid down;
Nearer to leave the heavy cross,
Nearer to gain the crown.

E'en now, perchance, my feet
Are slipping on the brink,
And I, today, am nearer home,
Nearer than now I think.

Father, perfect my trust!
Strengthen my pow'r of faith!
Nor let me stand, at last, alone
Upon the shore of death.
