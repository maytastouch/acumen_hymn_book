## No Night There

In the land of endless day
lies the city four-square;
it shall never pass away
and there is no night there.

Chorus
God shall wipe away all tears;
there's no death, no pain, nor fears;
and thy count not time by years
for there is no night there.

All the gates of pearl are made
in the city four-square;
all the streets with gold are laid,
and there is no night there.

And the gates shall never close
in the city four-square,
there life's crystal river flows,
and there is no night there. 

There thy need no sunshine bright,
in that city four-square;
for the Lamb is all the light,
and there is no night there.
