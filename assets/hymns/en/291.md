## Worthy, Worthy, Is The Lamb

Worthy, worthy, is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb;
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb
That was slain.

Chorus
Glory, hallelujah! 
Praise him, hallelujah!
Glory, hallelujah
To the Lamb!

Saviour, let thy kingdom come!
Now the pow'r of sin consume;
Bring thy blest millennium,
Holy Lamb.

Thus may we each moment feel,
Love him, serve him, praise him still,
Till we all on Zion's hill
See the Lamb.
