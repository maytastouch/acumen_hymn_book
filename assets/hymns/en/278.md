## Not My Way

Thy way, not mine, O Lord,
however dark it be;
lead me by thine own hand,
choose out the path for me.

The kingdom that I seek
is thine, so let the way
that leads to it be thine,
else I must surely stray.

Choose thou for me my friends,
my sickness or my health;
choose thou my cares for me,
my poverty or wealth.
