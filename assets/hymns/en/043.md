## Asleep In Jesus

Asleep, in Jesus! Blessed sleep,
From which none ever wakes to weep;
A calm and undisturbed repose,
Unbroken by the last of foes.

Asleep in Jesus! Oh, how sweet
To be for such a slumber meet,
With holy confidence to sing
That death has lost his venomed sting!

Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest,
Whose waking is supremely blest;
No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour
That manifests the Savior's pow'r.

Asleep in Jesus! O for me
May such a blissful refuge be!
Securely shall my ashes lie
And wait the summons from on high.
