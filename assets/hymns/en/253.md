## See, Israel's Gentle Shepherd

See Israel's gentle Shepherd stand
with all-engaging charms;
hark! how he calls the tender lambs,
and folds them in his arms.

"Permit them to approach," he cries,
"nor scorn their humble name;
for 'twas to bless such souls as these
the Lord of angels came."

We bring them, Lord, in thankful hands,
and yield them up to thee;
joyful that we ourselves are thine,
thine let our offspring be.
