## O For That Flame

Oh, for the flame of living fire,
Which shone so bright in saints of old,
Which bade their souls to heav’n aspire,
Calm in distress, in danger bold!

Where is that Spirit, Lord, who dwelt
In Abram’s breast, and sealed him Thine?
Which made Paul’s heart with sorrow melt,
And glow with energy divine?

That Spirit who, from age to age,
Proclaimed Thy love, and taught Thy ways,
Brightened Isaiah’s vivid page,
And breathed in David’s hallowed lays!

Is not Thy grace as mighty now
As when Elijah felt its pow’r?
When glory beamed from Moses’ brow,
Or Job endured the trying hour?

Remember, Lord, the ancient days;
Renew Thy work, Thy grace restore;
And while to Thee our hearts we raise,
On us Thy holy Spirit pour!
