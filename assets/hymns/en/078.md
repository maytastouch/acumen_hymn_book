## Seeking The Lost

Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating
Wanderers on the mountain astray;
“Come unto Me,” His message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking today.

Chorus
Going afar upon the mountain,
Bringing the wand'rer back again, back again,
Into the fold of my Redeemer, 
Jesus, the Lamb for sinners slain, for sinners slain.

Seeking the lost and pointing to Jesus
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life evermore.

Thus would I go on missions of mercy,
Following Christ from day unto day,
Cheering the faint and raising the fallen,
Pointing the lost to Jesus, the Way.
