## Lead Me, Saviour

Savior, lead me lest I, stray,
Gently lead me all the way;
I am safe when by thy side,
I would in thy love abide.

Chorus
Lead me, lead me.
Savior, lead me lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me, Savior, all the way.

Thou the refuge of my soul,
When lifeâ€™s stormy billows roll;
I am safe when thou art nigh,
All my hopes on thee rely. 

Savior, lead me, then at last,
When the storm of life is past;
To the land of endless day,
Where all tears are wiped away.
