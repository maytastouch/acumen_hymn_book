## Beautiful Valley of Eden

Beautiful valley of Eden!
Sweet is thy noontide calm;
Over the hearts of the weary,
Breathing thy waves of balm.

Chorus
Beautiful valley of Eden,
Home of the pure and blest,
How often amid the wild billows
I dream of thy rest, sweet rest!

Over the heart of the mourner
Shineth thy golden day,
Wafting the songs of the angels
Down from the far away. 

There is the home of my Savior;
There, with the blood-washed throng,
Over the highlands of glory
Rolleth the great new song.
