## Lord Dismiss Us

Lord, dismiss us with your blessing;
fill our hearts with joy and peace;
let us each, your love possessing,
triumph in redeeming grace.
O refresh us, O refresh us,
trav'ling through this wilderness.

Thanks we give and adoration
for your gospel's joyful sound:
may the fruits of your salvation
in our hearts and lives abound:
ever faithful, ever faithful
to the truth may we be found.

Of your love some gracious token
grant us, Lord, before we go;
bless your word which has been spoken,
life and peace on all bestow.
O direct us and protect us
in the paths we do not know.

So that when your love shall call us,
Savior, from the world away,
let no fear of death appall us,
glad your summons to obey:
may we ever, may we ever
reign with you in endless day.
