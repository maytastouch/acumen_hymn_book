## Lovingly, Tenderly Calling.

Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
Calleth thee now to come
Into the fold of safety,
Where there is rest and room;
Come in the strength of manhood,
Come in the morn of youth,
Enter the fold of safety,
Enter the way of truth.

Chorus
Lovingly, tenderly calling is he,
“Wanderer, wanderer, come unto me;”
Patiently waiting, there standing I see
Jesus, my Shepherd divine.

Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
Gave his dear life for thee;
Tenderly now he’s calling,
“Wanderer, come to me:”
Haste! for without is danger,
“Come,” cries the Shepherd blest;
Enter the fold of safety,
Enter the place of rest.

Lingering is but folly,
Wolves are abroad today,
Seeking the sheep who’re straying,
Seeking the lambs to slay;
Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
Calleth thee now to come;
Enter the fold of safety,
Where there is rest and room.
