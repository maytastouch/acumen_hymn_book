## I Need The Every Hour

I need thee every hour,
most gracious Lord;
no tender voice like thine
can peace afford.

Chorus
I need thee, O I need thee;
every hour I need thee!
O bless me now, my Savior,
I come to thee.

I need thee every hour,
stay thou near by;
temptations lose their power
when thou art nigh.

I need thee every hour, 
in joy or pain;
come quickly, and abide,
or life is vain.

I need thee every hour;
teach me thy will,
and thy rich promises
in me fulfill.
