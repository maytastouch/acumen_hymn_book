## Baptize Us Anew

Baptize us anew
With pow'r from on high,
With love, O refresh us!
Dear Saviour, draw nigh.

Chorus
We humbly beseech thee, Lord, Jesus, we pray,
With love and the Spirit baptize us to-day.

Unworthy we cry,
Unholy, unclean, 
O wash us and cleanse us
From sin's guilty stain.

O heavenly dove,
Descend from on high!
We plead thy rich blessing;
In mercy draw nigh.

O list the glad voice!
From heaven it came:
Thou art my beloved,
Well pleased I am.
