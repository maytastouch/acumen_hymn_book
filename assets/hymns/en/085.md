## I Sing The Mighty Power

We sing the mighty power of God 
that made the mountains rise, 
that spread the flowing seas abroad 
and built the lofty skies. 
We sing the wisdom that ordained 
the sun to rule the day; 
the moon shines full at his command, 
and all the stars obey. 

We sing the goodness of the Lord 
that filled the earth with food; 
he formed the creatures with his word 
and then pronounced them good. 
Lord, how your wonders are displayed, 
where'er we turn our eyes, 
if we survey the ground we tread 
or gaze upon the skies. 

There's not a plant or flower below 
but makes your glories known, 
and clouds arise and tempests blow 
by order from your throne; 
while all that borrows life from you 
is ever in your care, 
and everywhere that we can be, 
you, God, are present there.
