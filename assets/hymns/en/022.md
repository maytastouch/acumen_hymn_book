## Lord I Hear

Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessings,
Thou art scatt'ring full and free;
Show'rs the thirsty souls refreshing,
Let some drops now fall on me!
Even me, Lord, even me.
Even me, Lord, even me.
Let some drops now fall on me!

Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
Sinful though my heart may be;
I am longing for Thy favor,
Whilst Thou art blessing, O bless me!
Even me, Lord, even me.
Even me, Lord, even me
Whilst Thou art blessing, Lord, bless me!

Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,
Ever let me feed on Thee;
Vine of heaven, Vine of heaven,
Let Thy blood atone for me!
Even me, Lord, even me.
Even me, Lord, even me.
Let Thy blood atone for me!
