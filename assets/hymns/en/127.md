## He Loves Me Too

God sees the little sparrow fall,
it meets his tender view;
if God so loves the little birds,
I know he loves me too.

Chorus
He loves me too, he loves me too,
I know loves me too;
because he loves the little things,
I know loves me too.

He paints the lily of the field,
perfumes each lily bell;
if he so loves the little flow'rs,
I know he loves me well.

God made the little birds and flow'rs,
and all things large and small;
he'll not forget his little ones,
I know he loves them all.
