## Life in A Look

There is life for a look at the crucified one,
There is life at this moment for thee;
Then look, sinner, look unto him and be saved,
Unto him who was nailed to the tree.

Chorus
Look, look, look and live;
There is life for a look at the crucified one,
There is life at this moment for thee.

O why was he there as the bearer of sin,
If on Jesus thy sins were not laid?
O why from his side flowed the sin-cleansing blood,
If his dying thy debt had not paid?

It is not thy tears of repentance or prayers,
But the blood that atones for the soul;
On him then who shed it thou mayest at once
Thy weight of iniquities roll.

Then take with rejoicing from Jesus at once
The life everlasting he gives;
And know, with assurance, thou needâ€™st never die
Since Jesus, thy righteousness, lives.
