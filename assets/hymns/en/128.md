## Blessed Hour of Prayer

'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;
If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

Chorus
Blessed hour of prayer, 
Blessed hour of prayer:
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!

'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,
With a tender compassion His children to hear;
When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,
What a balm for the weary, O how sweet to be there! (Chorus)

'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried
To the Savior Who loves them their sorrow confide;
With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there! (Chorus)

At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe
That the blessing we're needing we'll surely receive;
In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there! (Chorus)
