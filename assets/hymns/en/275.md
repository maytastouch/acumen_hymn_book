## Eternity! Where?

"Eternity! where?" It floats in the air;
Amid clamor or silence it ever is there!
The question so solemn "Eternity! where?" 
The question so solemn "Eternity! where?"

"Eternity! where?" Oh! Eternity! where?
With redeemed ones in glory? or lost in despair?
'Tis one or the other "Eternity! where?"
'Tis one or the other "Eternity! where?"

"Eternity! where?" Oh! how can you share
The world's giddy pleasures, or heedlessly dare
Do aught till you settle "Eternity! where?"
Do aught till you settle "Eternity! where?"

"Eternity! where?" Oh! friend, have a care;
Soon God will no longer His judgment forbear;
This day may decide your "Eternity! where?"
This day may decide your "Eternity! where?"

"Eternity! where?" Oh! Eternity! where?
Friend, sleep not, nor take in the world any share,
Till you answer this question "Eternity! where?"
Till you answer this question "Eternity! where?"
