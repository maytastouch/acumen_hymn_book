## Angry Words! Oh, Let Them Never

Angry words! oh, let them never
From the tongue unbridled slip:
May the heart's best impulse ever
Check them ere they soil the lip.

Chorus
"Love one another," thus saith the Saviour;
Let us obey the Father's blest command;
"Love one another," thus saith the Saviour;
Let us obey His blest command.

Love is much too pure and holy,
Friendship is too sacred far,
For a moment's reckless folly
Thus to desolate and mar.

Angry words are lightly spoken,
Bitt'rest tho'ts are rashly stirred,
Brightest links of life are broken,
By a single angry word.
