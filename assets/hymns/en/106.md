## Build on the Rock

We'll build on the Rock, the living rock,
On Jesus, the Rock of Ages;
So shall we abide the fearful shock,
When loud the tempest rages.

Chorus
We'll build on the Rock,
We'll build on the Rock;
We'll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,
On Christ, the mighty Rock.

Some build on the sinking sands of life,
On visions of earthly treasure;
Some build on the waves of sin and strife,
Of fame, and worldly pleasure. 

O build on the Rock, forever sure,
The firm and the true foundation;
Its hope is the hope which shall endure,
The hope of our salvation.
