## Just For Today

Lord, for tomorrow and its needs
I do not pray;
keep me, my God, from stain of sin,
just for today.

Let me both diligently work
and duly pray;
let me be kind in word and deed,
just for today.

Let me no wrong or idle word
unthinking say;
set thou a seal upon my lips,
just for today.

And if today my tide of life
should ebb away,
give me thy sacraments divine,
sweet Lord, today.

So, for tomorrow and its needs
I do not pray;
but keep me, guide me, love me, Lord,
just for today.
