## We'll Tarry By The Living Waters

We'll tarry by the living waters,
The fountain pure and free;
There Jesus waits to give us welcome,
A welcome sweet 'twill be.

Chorus
We'll tarry by the living waters,
Tarry by the living waters;
Tarry by the living waters,
Tarry by the Fount of Life.

When weary with the toilsome journey,
'Tis sweet to rest awhile
Where crystal waters gently murmur,
And sunny fountains smile.

Then come to Christ, the living water,
Thy strength will he restore;
Come, taste the joy of his salvation,
And drink to thirst no more.
