## Hover O'er Me, Holy Spirit

Hover o'er me, Holy Spirit,
Bathe my trembling heart and brow;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, oh, come and fill me now. 

Chorus
Fill me now, fill me now,
Holy Spirit, fill me now;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, oh, come, and fill me now. 

Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,
Though I cannot tell Thee how;
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee,
Come, oh, come and fill me now.

I am weakness, full of weakness,
At Thy sacred feet I bow;
Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
Fill with pow'r, and fill me now.

Cleanse and comfort, wholly save me,
Bathe, oh, bathe my heart and brow;
Thou dost sanctify and seal me,
Thou art sweetly filling now.
