## I Remember Calvary

Where He may lead me I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him so,
And I remember 'twas for me
That he was slain on Calvary.

Chorus
Jesus shall lead me night and day,
Jesus shall lead me all the way,
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

O I delight in His command,
Love to be led by His dear hand;
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.

Onward I go, nor doubt nor fear,
Happy with Christ, my Savior, near,
Trusting that I some day shall see
Jesus, my Friend, of Calvary.
