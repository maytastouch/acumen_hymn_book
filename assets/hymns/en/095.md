## Safely Through Another Week

Safely through another week
God has brought us on our way;
let us now a blessing seek,
waiting in his courts today;
day of all the week the best,
emblem of eternal rest.

While we pray for pard'ning grace
through the dear Redeemer's name,
show thy reconciled face;
take away our sin and shame;
from our earthly cares set free,
may we rest this day in thee.

Here we come thy name to praise;
let us feel thy presence near;
may thy glory meet our eyes
while we in thy house appear;
here afford us, Lord, a taste
of our everlasting feast.

May thy gospel's joyful sound
conquer sinners, comfort saints;
may the fruits of grace abound,
bring relief for all complaints;
thus may all our Sabbaths prove,
'til we join the church above.
