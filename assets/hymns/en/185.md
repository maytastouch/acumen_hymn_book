## To Be There

We speak of the realms of the blest,
That country so bright and so fair,
And oft are its glories confessed;
But what must it be to be there!

We speak of its freedom from sin,
From sorrow, temptation and care,
From trials without and within;
But what must it be to be there!

Do thou, Lord, in pleasure or woe,
For Heaven our spirits prepare;
Then soon shall we joyfully know
And feel what it is to be there.
