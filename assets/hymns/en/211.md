## Showers of Blessing

There shall be showers of blessing: 
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing, 
Sent from the Savior above. 

Chorus
Showers of blessing,(Showers, showers of blessing) 
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops 'round us are falling, 
But for the showers we plead. 

There shall be showers of blessing-- 
Precious reviving again; 
Over the hills and the valleys, 
Sound of abundance of rain. 

There shall be showers of blessing: 
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing; 
Come and now honor Thy word.

There shall be showers of blessing: 
Oh, that today they might fall, 
Now as to God we're confessing, 
Now as on Jesus we call!
