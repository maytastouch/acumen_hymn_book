## The Lord's our Rock

The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide 
A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever ill betide 
A shelter in the time of storm.

Chorus
O Jesus is a Rock in a weary land,
A weary land, a weary land;
O Jesus is a Rock in a weary land 
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shade by day, defense by night 
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes affright 
A shelter in the time of storm.

The raging storms may round us beat 
A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat 
A shelter in the time of storm.

O Rock divine, O Refuge dear 
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our helper ever near 
A shelter in the time of storm.
