## I Need Thee, Precious Jesus

I need Thee, precious Jesus, For I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store.
I need the love of Jesus, To cheer me on my way,
To guide my doubting footsteps, To be my strength and stay. 

I need the heart of Jesus, To feel each anxious care;
To tell my evâ€™ry trial, And all my sorrows share,
I need the Holy Spirit, To teach me what I am
To show me more of Jesus, To point me to the Lamb 

I need Thee, precious Jesus, I hope to see Thee soon
Encircled with the rainbow, And seated on thy throne.
There, with Thy blood-bought children, My joy shall ever be,
To sing Thy ceaseless praises, To gaze my Lord, on Thee! Amen.
