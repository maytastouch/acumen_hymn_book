## We Praise Thee, O God

We praise thee, O God, for the Son of thy love,
For Jesus who died and is now gone above.

Chorus
Hallelujah, thine the glory!
Hallelujah, Amen!
Hallelujah, thine the glory!
Revive us again.

We praise thee, O God, for thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior and scattered our night.

All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins and has cleansed ev'ry stain.

Revive us again -- fill each heart with thy love;
May each soul be rekindled with fire from above.
