## Lord, In the Morning

Lord, in the morning you shall hear
my voice ascending high;
to you I will direct my prayer,
to you lift up my eye.

O may your spirit guide my feet
to go in righteous ways!
God, make my path of duty straight
and plain before my face.

The ones who love your glorious name
shall see their hopes fulfilled;
the mighty God will compass them
with favor as a shield.
