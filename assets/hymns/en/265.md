## Peace, Perfect Peace

Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within. 

Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed? 
To do the will of Jesus: this is rest 

Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round?
On Jesus’ bosom nought but calm is found. 

Peace, perfect peace, with loved far away?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
In Jesus’ keeping we are safe, and they. 

Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
