## Tis Love That Makes Us Happy

'Tis love that makes us happy,
'Tis love that smoothes the way;
It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.

Chorus
God is love; we're His little children.
God is love; we would be like Him.
'Tis love that makes us happy,
'Tis love that smoothes the way;
It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.

This world is full of sorrow,
Of sickness, death and sin;
With loving heart we'll do our part,
And try some soul to win.

And when this life is over,
And we are called above,
Our song shall be, eternally,
Of Jesus and His love.
