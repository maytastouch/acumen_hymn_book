## Watch, For the Time is Short

Watch, for the time is short;
Watch while 'tis called today;
Watch lest the world prevail;
Watch, Christian, watch and pray;
Watch, for the flesh is weak;
Watch, for the foe is strong;
Watch lest the Bridegroom come;
Watch, tho' he tarry long.

Chorus
O watch and pray,
O watch and pray;
O watch is the darkness, and watch in the day;
Christian, watch and pray.

Chase slumber from thine eyes,
Chase doubting from thy breast;
Thine is the promis'd prize 
Of heaven's eternal rest;
Watch, Christian, watch and pray;
Thy Saviour watched for thee
Till from his brow there poured
Great drops of agony.

Take Jesus for thy trust;
Watch while the foe is near;
Gird well the armor on;
Watch till thy Lord appear.
Now when thy sun is up,
Make thou no more delay,
In this accepted time
Watch, Christian, watch and pray.
