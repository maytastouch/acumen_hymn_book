## They Brought Their Gifts To Jesus

They bro't their gifts to Jesus,
And laid them at his feet,
And love for this dear Saviour,
Made ev'ry off'ring sweet;
Good deeds and words of kindness,
Help for the poor of earth,
And not a gift among them
Was tho't of little worth.

Chorus
Wouldst bring a gift to Jesus,
That he will count most sweet?
Say, "Lord, my heart I give thee,"
And lay it at his feet.

Apart from other givers
A poor wayfarer stood;
He saw the gifts they offered,
The poorest counted good,
And he was filled with longing,
A gift, tho' poor, to bring;
Alas! all empty handed 
He stood before the King.

"Dear Lord," he cried in sorrow,
"I know how kind thou art,
Take all I have to give thee,
My sinful, wayward heart."
Then Jesus answered softly,
"Count not the gift as small,
Tho' all of them are precious,
Thine is the best of all.
