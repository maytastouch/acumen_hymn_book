## On Jordan's Stormy Banks

On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, 
and cast a wishful eye 
to Canaan's fair and happy land, 
where my possessions lie. 

Chorus
I am bound for the promised land, 
I am bound for the promised land; 
oh, who will come and go with me? 
I am bound for the promised land. 

O'er all those wide extended plains 
shines one eternal day; 
there God the Son forever reigns, 
and scatters night away.

No chilling winds or poisonous breath 
can reach that healthful shore; 
sickness and sorrow, pain and death, 
are felt and feared no more.

When I shall reach that happy place, 
I'll be forever blest, 
for I shall see my Father's face, 
and in his bosom rest.
