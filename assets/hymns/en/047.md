## On Jordan's Stormy Banks

On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
and cast a wishful eye
to Canaan's fair and happy land,
where my possessions lie.

Chorus
We will rest in that fair and happy land...(by and by). 
Just across on the evergreen shore....(ever green shore). 
Sing the song of Moses and the Lamb by and by, 
And dwell with Jesus evermore.

O'er all those wide extended plains
shines one eternal day;
there God the Son forever reigns,
and scatters night away.


When I shall reach that happy place,
I'll be forever blest,
for I shall see my Father's face,
and in his bosom rest.

Fill'd with delight, my ruptured soul 
Would here no longer stay.
Tho' Jordan's waves around me roll, s
Fearless I'd launch away.
