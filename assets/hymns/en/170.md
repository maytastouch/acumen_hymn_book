## My Maker and My King

MY Maker and my King,
To thee my all I owe;
Thy constant goodness is the spring
Whence all my blessings flow.

The creature of thy hand,
On thee alone I live;
Thy countless benefits demand
More praise than I can give.

O let thy grace inspire
My soul with strength divine!
Let all my powers to thee aspire,
And all my days be thine.
