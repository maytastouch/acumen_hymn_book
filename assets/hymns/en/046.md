## Sing Them Over Again to Me

Sing them over again to me,
wonderful words of life;
let me more of their beauty see,
wonderful words of life;
words of life and beauty,
teach me faith and duty:

Chorus
Beautiful words, wonderful words,
wonderful words of life;
Beautiful words, wonderful words,
wonderful words of life.

Christ, the blessed One, gives to all
wonderful words of life;
sinner, list to the laving call,
wonderful words of life;
all so freely given,
wooing us to heaven: 

Sweetly echo the gospel call,
wonderful words of life;
offer pardon and peace to all,
wonderful words of life;
Jesus, only Savior,
sanctify forever,
