## Holy Day, Jehovah's Rest

Holy day, Jehovah’s rest,
Of creation’s week the best;
Last of all the chosen seven,
Blessed of God, to man ‘twas given. 

Chorus
Welcome, welcome,
(Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,)
Welcome welcome;
(welcome, welcome, ever welcome;)
Glad we hail its presence blest,
‘Tis the great Jehovah’s rest. 

First His six days’ work was done,
Then the Sabbath was begun;
Thus He blessed the seventh day,
Thus in resting we obey. 

Thousands have His plan reversed,
Resting now upon the first;
Search the book and you shall know,
There’s no scripture tells them so. 

All who speak the truth must say,
It was man who changed the day;
In God’s word no change appears,
Through the whole six thousand years. 

Thus I searched; and when I saw,
Only one great Sabbath law,
Then I Hasten to obey,
Plainly, ‘twas the only way.
