## Nearer, Still Nearer

Nearer, still nearer, close to thy heart,
draw me, my Savior, so precious thou art.
Fold me, O fold me close to thy breast;
shelter me safe in that haven of rest,
shelter me safe in that haven of rest.

Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
naught as an off'ring to Jesus my King--
only my sinful, now contrite heart;
grant me the cleansing thy blood doth impart,
grant me the cleansing thy blood doth impart.

Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be thine,
sin with its follies I gladly resign,
all of its pleasures, pomp, and its pride;
give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,
give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last,
till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
through endless ages, ever to be
nearer, my Savior, still nearer to thee,
nearer, my Savior, still nearer to thee.
