## Precious Name

Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe.
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it then where'er you go.

Chorus
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

Take the name of Jesus ever
As protection ev'rywhere. 
If temptations 'round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
When in heaven we shall meet,
King of kings, we'll gladly crown him
When our journey is complete.
