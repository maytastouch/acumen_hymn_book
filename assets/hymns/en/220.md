## The Homeland

The homeland! the homeland!
The land of the free-born;
There’s no night in the homeland,
But aye the fadeless morn;
I’m sighing for the homeland,
My heart is aching here;
There’s no pain in the homeland
To which I’m drawing near.

My Lord is in the homeland
With angels bright and fair;
There’s no sin in the homeland,
And no temptation there;
The voices of the homeland
Are ringing in my ears,
And when I think of the homeland
My eyes are filled with tears.

For those I love in the homeland
Are calling me away
To the rest and peace of the homeland,
And the life beyond decay;
For there’s no death in the homeland,
There is no grief above;
Christ brings us all to the homeland
Of his eternal love.
