## Sweet Sabbath School

Sweet Sabbath School! more dear to me
Than fairest palace dome,
My heart e'er turns with joy to thee,
My own dear Sabbath Home.

Chorus
Sabbath home! blessed home!
Sabbath home! blessed home!
My heart o'er turns with joy to thee,
My own dear Sabbath Home.

Here first my wilful, wand'ring heart,
The way of life was shown,
Here first I sought the better part,
And gained a Sabbath Home.

Here Jesus stood with loving voice,
Entreating me to come,
And make of Him my only choice,
In this dear Sabbath Home.
