## While Jesus Whispers

While Jesus whispers to you,
Come, sinner, come!
While we are praying for you,
Come, sinner come!
Now is the time to own Him,
Come, sinner, come!
Now is the time to know Him,
Come, sinner come!

Are you too, heavy laden?
Come, sinner, come!
Jesus will bear your burden,
Come, sinner come!
Jesus will not deceive you,
Come, sinner, come!
Jesus will now receive you,
Come, sinner come!

Why will you longer doubt Him?
Come, sinner, come!
What will you do without Him?
Come, sinner come!
For you His heart is yearning,
Come, sinner, come!
Why not to Him be turning?
Come, sinner come!

Far off you may have wandered,
Come, sinner, come!
God's gifts you may have squandered,
Come, sinner come!
Cease now, your heart to harden,
Come, sinner, come!
Jesus will freely pardon,
Come, sinner come!

Oh, hear His tender pleading,
Come, sinner, come!
Come and receive the blessing,
Come, sinner come!
While Jesus whispers to you,
Come, sinner, come! 
While we are praying for you,
Come, sinner come!
