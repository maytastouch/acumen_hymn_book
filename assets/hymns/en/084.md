## Singing As We Journey

Children of the heav'nly King,
as you journey, sweetly sing;
sing your Savior's worthy praise,
glorious in his works and ways.

We are trav'ling home to God
in the way the pilgrims trod;
they are happy now, and we
soon their happiness shall see.

Lift your eyes and see the light;
Zion's city is in sight!
There our endless home shall be;
there our Lord we soon shall see.

Fear not, children, joyful stand
on the borders of your land;
Jesus Christ, your Father's Son,
bids you undismayed go on.

Lord, obediently we go,
gladly leaving all below;
lead us now in all we do
and we still will follow you.
