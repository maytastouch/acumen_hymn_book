## Lord We Have Met.

Lord we have met again;
In this thine house of prayer.
Come Holy Spirit, later rain;
And fill us with thy power.

Our hearts to Thee we give;
That we may be like Thee.
Our souls, our minds dear Lord revive;
Our spirits yearn for Thee.

And when Thy word is read;
Thy call to us is made.
May we in gratitude respond;
To Thy sweet voice above.

Prepare for us a place;
In Thy dear heavâ€™n above.
Where all is peace, and joy, and love;
That we may rest in peace.
