## In The Hour Of Trial

In the hour of trial, 
Jesus, plead for me
Lest by base denial 
I unworthy be.
When you see me waver, 
With a look recall,
Nor for fear or favor 
Ever let me fall.

With forbidden pleasures 
Should this vain world charm
Or its tempting treasures 
Spread to work me harm,
Bring to my remembrance 
Sad Gethsemane
Or, in darker semblance, 
Cross-crowned Calvary.

Should your mercy send me 
Sorrow, toil, and woe,
Or should pain attend me 
On my path below,
Grant that I may never 
Fail your cross to view;
Grant that I may ever 
Cast my care on you.
