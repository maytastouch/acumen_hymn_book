## Unshaken As The Sacred Hills 

Unshaken as the sacred hills,
And fix'd as mountains stand;
Firm as a rock the soul shall rest
That trusts th' Almighty hand.

Not walls nor hills could guard so well
Fair Salem's happy ground,
As these eternal arms of love
That ev'ry saint surround.

Do good, O Lord, do good to those
Who cleave to thee in heart,
Who on thy truth alone repose,
Nor from thy law depart.
