## We'll Never Say Goodbye

Our friends on earth we meet with pleasure,
While swift the moments fly,
Yet ever comes the tho’t of sadness,
That we must say goodbye.

Chorus
We’ll never say goodbye in heav’n,
We’ll never say goodbye,
For in that land of joy and song
We’ll never say goodbye.

How joyful is the tho’t that lingers,
When loved ones cross death’s sea,
That when our labors here are ended,
With them we’ll ever be.

No parting words shall e’er be spoken
In that bright land of flow’rs,
But songs of joy, and peace, and gladness
Shall evermore be ours. å
