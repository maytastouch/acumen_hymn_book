## Who, Who Are These?

Who, who are these beyond the chilly wave,
Just past the borders of the silent grave,
Shouting Jesus’ power to save?
Washed in the blood of the Lamb. 

CHORUS
Sweeping through the gates to the new Jerusalem,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb;
Sweeping through the gates to the New Jerusalem,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb. 

These, these are they who in their youthful days,
Found Jesus early, and in wisdom’s way,
Proved the fullness of his grace,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb. 

These, these are they who in affliction’s woes,
Ever have found in Jesus calm repose,
Peace which from a pure heart flows,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb. 

These, these are they who in the conflict dire,
Boldly have stood amid the hottest fire;
Jesus now says “Come up higher,”
Washed in the blood of the Lamb. 

Safe, safe upon the ever-shining shore,
Sin, pain, and death, and sorrow all are o’er;
Happy now and ever more,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb.
