## Nothing For Jesus

Crowded is your heart with cares,
Have you no room for Jesus?
Captured by earth’s gilded snares,
Have you no room for Jesus?
Lo! he’s standing at your door,
Knocking, knocking o’er and o’er;
Hear him pleading evermore,
Have you no room for Jesus?

Chorus
Have you no room for Jesus?
Have you no room for Jesus?
Hear Him pleading evermore;
Have you no room for Jesus?

Wasting all your precious hours,
Can you not work for Jesus?
Vainly spending all you pow’rs;,
Can you not work for Jesus?
Striving not to conquer sin;
Seeking not a soul to win;
Bringing not a wand’rer in;
Can you not work for Jesus?

Bearing only worthless leaves,
Have you no fruit for Jesus?
In your hand no precious sheaves;
Have you no fruit for Jesus?
Not a grain to store away;
Naught your labor to repay;
Not a joy for that great day
When you shall meet with Jesus?
