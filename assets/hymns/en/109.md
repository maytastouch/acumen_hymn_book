## Weighed and Wanting

When the Judge shall weigh our motives,
For eternal gain or loss,
Shall we stand as gold before him?
Or as vile and worthless dross?

Chorus
Weigh'd in the balance of the Lord,
Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting;
Weigh'd by the standard of his word,
Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting.

Shall we hear the glad words spoken:
"Faithful servant," and "Well done,"
Or the dread and awful sentence,
"Thou are wanting," sinful one?

Shall we heed the Spirit's pleading,
While for mercy we may call,
Or delay till God's handwriting
Seals the final doom of all?
