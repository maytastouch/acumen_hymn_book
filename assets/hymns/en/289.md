## Take Me As I Am

Jesus, my Lord, to thee I cry;
Unless thou help me I must die;
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am. 

Chorus
Take me as I am, Take me as I am,
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am. 

Helpless I am, and full of guilt,
But yet thy blood for me was spilt; 
And thou canst make what thou wilt,
But take me as I am. 

No preparation can I make,
My best resolves I only break;
Yet save me for thine own name’s sake,
And take me as I am. 

I bow before thy mercy seat,
Behold me, Saviour, at thy feet;
Thy work begin, thy work complete,
And take me as I am. 

If thou hast work for me to do,
Inspire my will, my heart renew; 
And work both in, and by me, too, 
And take me as I am. 

And when at last the work is done,
The battle fought, the vict’ry won;
Still, still my cry shall be alone,
Lord, take me as I am.
