## Another Six Days' Work

Another six days' work is done,
Another Sabbath is begun;
Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest,
Improve the day that God has blessed.

Come, bless the Lord, whose love assigns
So sweet a rest to weary minds;
A blessed antepast is giv'n,
On this day more than all the sev'n.

O that our thoughts and thanks may rise
As grateful incense to the skies,
And draw from Christ that sweet repose
Which none but he who feels it knows.

This heav'nly calm within the breast
Is the best pledge of glorious rest,
Which for the church of God remains,
The end of cares, the end of pains.
