## I Am The Way

Like wand’ring sheep o’er mountains cold,
Since all have gone astray;
To “Life” and peace within the fold,
How may I find the way?

Chorus
I am the way, the Truth, and the Life;
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.
I am the way, the truth, and the life;
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

Bewildered oft with doubt and care,
To God I fain would go;
But while they cry, “Lo here! lo there!”
The Truth how may I know?

To Christ the Way, the Truth, the Life,
I come, no more to roam;
He’ll guide me to my “Father’s house,”
To my eternal home.
