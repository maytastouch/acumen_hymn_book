## The Coming King.

The coming King is at the door,
Who once the cross for sinners bore
But now the righteous ones alone
He comes to gather home. 

CHORUS
At the door…. At the door…
At the door, yes, even at the door.
He is coming, He is coming 
He is even at the door. 

The signs that show his coming near,
Are fast fulfilling year by year,
And soon we'll hail the glorious dawn
Of heaven's eternal morn. 

Look not on earth for strife to cease,
Look not below for joy and peace,
Until the Saviour comes again,
To banish death and sin. 

Then in that glorious earth made new,
We'll dwell the countless ages thro';
This mortal shall immortal be,
And time eternity.
