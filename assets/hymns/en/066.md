## Happy Day

O happy day that fixed my choice 
On Thee, my Savior and my God! 
Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 
And tell its raptures all abroad.

Chorus
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 
He taught me how to watch and pray, 
And live rejoicing ev'ry day; 
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away.

'Tis done-- the great transaction's done; 
I am my Lord's, and He is mine; 
He drew me and I followed on, 
Rejoicing in the call divine.

Now rest, my long-divided heart, 
Fixed on this blissful center rest; 
Here have I found a nobler part, 
Here heav'nly pleasures fill my breast.

High heav'n that hears the solemn vow, 
That vow renewed shall daily hear; 
Till in life's latest hour I bow, 
And bless in death a bond so dear.
