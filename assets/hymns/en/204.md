## Welcome! Wonderer, Come!

In the land of strangers,
Whither thou art gone,
Hear a far voice calling,
"My son! my son!"
Welcome! wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away:
Come home! come home!"

"From the land of hunger,
Fainting, famished, lone,
Come to love and gladness,
"My son! my son!"
"Welcome! wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away:
Come home! come home!"

Leave the haunts of riot,
Wasted, woe begone,
Sick at heart and weary,
My son! my son!
"Welcome! wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away:
Come home! come home!"

See the door still open!
Thou art still my own;
Eyes of love are on thee, 
My son! my son!
"Welcome! wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away:
Come home! come home!"

Far off thou hast wandered;
Wilt hou farther roam?
Come, and all is pardoned,
My son! my son!
"Welcome! wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away:
Come home! come home!"

See the well-spread table,
Unforgotten one!
Here is rest and plenty,
My son! my son!
"Welcome! wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away:
Come home! come home!"

Thou art friendless, homeless,
Hopeless and undone;
Mine is love unchanging,
My son! my son!"
"Welcome! wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away:
Come home! come home!"
