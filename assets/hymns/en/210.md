## What a Wonderful Saviour

Christ has for sin atonement made, 
what a wonderful Saviour!
We are redeemed! The price is paid! 
What a wonderful Saviour! 

CHORUS
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord! 

I praise Him for the cleansing blood,
What a wonderful Saviour!
That reconciled my soul to God;
What a wonderful Saviour! 

He cleansed my heart from all its sin,
What a wonderful Saviour!
And now He reigns and rules therein;
What a wonderful Saviour! 

He walks beside me all the way,
What a wonderful Saviour!
And keeps me faithful day by day,
What a wonderful Saviour! 

He gives me overcoming power,
What a wonderful Saviour! 
And triumph in each trying hour; 
What a wonderful Saviour! 

To Him Iâ€™ve given all my heart,
What a wonderful Saviour!
The world shall never share a part,
What a wonderful Saviour!
