## Weeping Will Not Save Me

Weeping will not save me, Tho’ my face were bathed in tears,
That could not allay my fears, Could not wash the sins of years,
Weeping will not save me. 

CHORUS
Jesus wept and died for me; Jesus suffered on the tree;
Jesus waits to make me free: He alone can save me. 

Working will not save me, Purest deeds that I can do,
Holiest thoughts and feelings, too, Can not form my soul anew,
Working will not save me 

Waiting will not save me, Helpless, guilty, lost I lie,
In my ear is mercy’s cry; If I wait I can but die,
Waiting will not save me. 

Faith in Christ will save me, Let me trust thy weeping Son,
Trust the work that he has done; To his arms, Lord, help me run,
Faith in Christ will save me.
