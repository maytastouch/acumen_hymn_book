## Our Blessed Redeemer

Our blest Redeemer, ere, He breathed his tender last fare-well,
A guide, a Comforter, bequeathed, With us to dwell 

He came sweet influence to impart, A gracious, willing guest,
While He can find one humble heart, Where in to rest. 

And His that gentle voice we hear, Soft as the breath of even,
That checks the wrong, that calms the fear, And speaks of heaven. 

And every virtue we possess, And every victory won,
And every thought of holiness, Are His alone. 

Spirit of purity and grace, Our weakness, pitying, see;
O make our hearts, Thy dwelling place, Till all like Thee.
