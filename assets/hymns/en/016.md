## I Washed My Hands

I washed my hands this morning,
O very clean and white,
And lent them both to Jesus,
To work for Him till night.

Chorus
Little feet be careful
Where you take me to,
Anything for Jesus,
Only let me do.

I told my ears to listen
Quite closely all day thro',
For any act of kindness
Such little hands can do.

My eyes are set to watch them
About their work or play,
To keep them out of mischief
For Jesus' sake all day.
