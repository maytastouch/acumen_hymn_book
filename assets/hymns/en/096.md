## Welcome, Welcome, Day of Rest

Welcome, welcome, day of rest,
To the world in kindness giv'n;
Welcome to this humble breast,
As the beaming light from heaven.

Day of calm and sweet repose,
Gently now thy moments run;
Balm to soothe our cares and woes,
Till our labor here is done.

Holy day that most we prize,
Day of solemn praise and prayer,
Day to make the simple wise,
O, how great thy blessings are!
